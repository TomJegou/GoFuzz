# Development of a Web Fuzzing Tool to Identify Entry Points in a Web Application

## Introduction:
The aim of this project is to design and develop an automated web fuzzing tool to identify potential entry points in a web application. This tool will help in detecting security vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, XSS, and other weaknesses by testing various inputs in input fields, URLs, HTTP headers, etc.

## Objectives:
* Design and develop an automated web fuzzing tool.
* Identify possible entry points in a web application.

## Expected Features of the Tool:
* Automated sending of HTTP requests with generated payloads.
* Recording and management of received responses for further analysis.

## Technical Specifications:
* Programming Language: Golang.

## Expected Deliverables:
* Source code of the tool with comprehensive documentation for its usage.
* Installation and configuration guide.

## Constraints:
* Adherence to security standards and confidentiality while testing third-party applications.
* Compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding security testing.
